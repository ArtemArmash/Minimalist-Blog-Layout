# Minimalist Blog / Gallery Page Layout

This project is a static, single-page website that showcases a clean, elegant, two-column grid layout for blog posts or gallery items. It is designed to demonstrate modern front-end web development techniques, particularly the use of CSS Flexbox for layout, custom web fonts for typography, and CSS variables for a maintainable color scheme.

## About The Project

This is a visually focused project that serves as a perfect example for anyone learning modern web design and CSS. It moves beyond basic layouts to create a professional and aesthetically pleasing user interface. The design is clean, spacious, and puts a strong emphasis on the content and imagery.

### Key Concepts and Features

*   **Advanced CSS Layout**: The entire page structure is built using **CSS Flexbox**, which provides a powerful and efficient way to create responsive grid systems.
*   **Custom Web Fonts**: The project imports and uses custom fonts from **Google Fonts** (`Playfair Display` and `Ubuntu`) to achieve a sophisticated and unique typographic style.
*   **CSS Variables (Custom Properties)**: Colors are managed using CSS variables (e.g., `--main-color`), which makes it easy to maintain a consistent color palette and update it from one central place.
*   **Clean, Semantic HTML**: The HTML structure is well-organized using `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<nav>` tags, which is good for both readability and SEO.
*   **Card-Based Design**: Each article is presented as a "card" containing an image and text, a very common pattern in modern web design.
*   **Minimalist Aesthetic**: The design uses a limited color palette, ample whitespace, and clean lines to create a calming and professional feel.

## Project Structure

The project is composed of two primary files and requires an `images` folder:

*   **`index.html`**: The main HTML file. It contains all the page content, structured into a header, a main content area with three sections, and six article blocks.
*   **`style.css`**: The external stylesheet. This file contains all the styling rules, including the Flexbox layout, font definitions, colors, and button styling.
*   **`/images/` (Folder)**: This folder is **required** and must contain all the image files referenced in the `index.html` file.

    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```sh

    ```
3.  **Create the `images` Folder**:
    *   Inside the main project folder, create a new folder and name it `images`.
    *   Place all the necessary image files (`.jpg` files referenced in `index.html`) inside this `images` folder.
4.  **Open the Webpage**:
    *   Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge). You can usually do this by double-clicking the file.
